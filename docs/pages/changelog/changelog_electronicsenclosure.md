Quality of life + printability!
1. Skirt Feet version 1.04.
   1. Added a V shape to the screw access holes in the bottom, which should make printing the part easier.
   2. The part has been adjusted to also fit M5 button screws.
   3. Check the screenshot [here](#lightbox_vshape_feet).
   4. These files can be found in the configurator or documentation GitHub.
2. 5 Pro / Plus bottom panel.
   1. Both bottom panels now support a cutout for the printed feet, making it easier to install after installation.
   2. These files can be found in the configurator or documentation GitHub.
3. Remove support stock ender feet.
   1. We've decided to remove the support of the stock feet, these are too thin and week to support the printer properly.
